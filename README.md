# GIS, Inc Tech Blog
Staging area for GIS, Inc Blog Posts, for technical and content review.

## Guidelines
Just a few things to keep in mind while writing; a good technical blog post:

* Describes the problem before presenting a solution 
* Solves a problem 
* Explains how to do something 
* Is concise and to the point 
* Is something you might be happy to see in a list of search results 
* Can be boiled down to a one or two sentence summary, and still sound like something you'd read 
* Hasn't already been written (how long did you spend searching for an answer?) 
* Is fun (funny) to read.

## Workflow
Posts will be published every other Tuesday, and we'll schedule folks to write articles the month before.  The worflow will be something like:

* Add your name and topic to the schedule
* Double check with your supervisor
* Write your post
* Post it to github
* Let others know it's ready for review

## Format
Plain text (i.e., markdown) is the easiest to work with, but don't let that be a blocker!  If you're more comfortable using a word doc or anything else, go for it.

If you're interested in learning about development workflows, writing a post in markdown and using git is a great way to get started.  If you need help getting your post into the repo, just ask.
