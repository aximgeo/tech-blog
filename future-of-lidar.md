Is Lidar a dying technology? No, I do not think so. The industry has to find the right applications for it. Is it the best way to acquire elevation data? No, at this point in time, I would argue using photogrammetry is the easiest and most cost efficient way of making elevation data sets. The word “phodar” or “fodar” recently has been popping up across the industry. This is a misrepresentation of what detection and ranging means. The sensor used for photogrammetry is a camera and has nothing to do with detection and ranging like Lidar and Radar. So why do people say these words? At a glance, Lidar and photogrammetry point clouds look the same. When dealing with these different datasets and determining which to use you must think of your end goal. Am I doing vegetation analysis? If so, I would recommend using Lidar since most Lidar is already classified when the LAS file is created. There is more of a manual process for classifying photogrammetric point clouds, it is not as easy. Software like Agisoft Photoscan and PIX4D are now adding options to classify the ground, which would allow for surface creation.

With recent releases, such as the solid state LeddarTech Vu8 sensor, I would not be surprised if Lidar makes its way into photographs. The Lidar units are becoming smaller and smaller and more easier to use. Lidar will not substitute the flash, but may work in the same fashion to measure the depth of the sensors surroundings. An extra band added to an RGB image would be a good way to store the elevation information. With all the advances in photogrammetry and drone technologies, we will find the right applications for Lidar. The competing forces between Lidar and photogrammetry can only be good for one another.
