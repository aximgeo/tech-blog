Have you ever looked up at a plane flying overhead and wondered what type of aircraft it was or where it was heading?   While there are a myriad of web and smart phone application to answer these questions for you, wouldn't it be nice to be able to capture the information directly from the airways using equipment you set up at your home?   If you've answered yes to these questions and are comfortable configuring hardware and installing software, then continue to read on to learn about an inexpensive way to do this from your home.

In order to get started with this project we need to take a quick sidetrip on the technology that makes all this possible.  The first is the ADS-B signals sent out by the aircraft.  ADS-B stands for [Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast#Description).  This signal is broadcast by most aircraft and contains information about the aircraft's speed, heading, altitude, location and identity, and is used to help avoid collisions and provide situational awareness beyond the current Air Traffic Control systems.  The second technology we will leverage for this application is Software Defined Radio (SDR).  Simply put, an SDR is a cheap and inexpensive piece of hardware you can purchase that when coupled with a computer acts, as a radio receiver.  The best place to read up on this is the site [RTL-SDR.COM](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/).  The final bit of tech we will be using is the [RaspBerry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#introWhatIs) - an inexpensive microcomputer that the system will run on.
